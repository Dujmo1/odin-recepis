      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>My Croatian husband loves cevapi, so I tried making some for him and he loved them. I made it with beef and veal, which I know is not traditional, but it was so delicious! This recipe has become a staple in our house!</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
            <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ pound ground veal</li>
